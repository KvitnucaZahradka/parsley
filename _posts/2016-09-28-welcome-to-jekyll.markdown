This is the blog-post about the application called `lazy ions`. The 
temporary web-page could be found [here]. The aim of the `lazy ions` is 
to analyse the future trendsetters for the new papers released on the 
[arXiv]. 

I am using the Ada - Boosted classifier trained on the set of trendsetters
vs. non-trendsetters papers and metadata downloaded from [arXiv]. The trendsetters 
are defined as the most cited authors in the period of last five years in 
certain area of research. The non-trendsetters are the authors that are 
not trendsetters but are still producing papers in given field.

My application `lazy ions` so far works only for `hep-th` field on arXiv.
I the future other areas will be included as well.

The `hep-th` papers predicted to be trendsetters by my application:

1. [paper 1]
2. [paper 2]
3. [paper 3]
4. [paper 4]
5. [paper 5]
6. [paper 6]
