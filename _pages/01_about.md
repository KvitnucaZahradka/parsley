My name is Martin Polacek. I like math, physics and programming. I am finishing Ph.D. degree at
at the [YITP][yitp] institute for theoretical physics at the [Stony Brook University][sb], [Stony Brook][sbrook], NY.

### Trivia

I have been born in the city of [Zilina][zln], [Slovakia][svk]. I obtained the
Master Degree (MSc.) in Theoretical Physics at the [Comenius University][cmn] in
[Bratislava][bts]. After that I moved to [New York City][nyc], where I currently live.
